# LiveSharedMobility

In this workshop we will develop an interactive web map that displays real-time micro-mobility data.  This will involve the use of [javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and a number of opensource (and not-so opensource) javascript libraries.  Specifically this workshop will focus on:

  * Leaflet
  * Mapbox
  * Leaflet Realtime

For data, we will displaying available [Lime](https://www.li.me/electric-scooter) vehicles.  These data can be accessed through the open application programming interface (API) made available via the Washington, D.C.'s [District Department of Transportation](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/dockless-api)
